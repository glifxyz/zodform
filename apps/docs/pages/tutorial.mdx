In this tutorial we will build a conference registration form.

The form will have the following requirements:
- A number of attendees can be added to the form
    - Each attendee will have a first name, last name and email address, all required
    - The first and last name inputs should be in one row, while the email address should be in another
    - A minimum of one attendee is required
- A checkbox for acceptance of the conference rules, this must be checked to submit the form
- There should be three products that may be selected to be purchased
  - A T-Shirt
  - A USB Stick
  - A backpack
- A payment method field should appear when at least one product is selected
  - The payment method should be presented as two radio buttons
  - The payment method should either be a debit card or PayPal
    - If debit card is selected, a card number field should appear and be required
- Finally, there should be a submit button to submit the form

## Installing the dependencies

First, let's install the ZodForm core dependencies:

```bash
pnpm i @zodform/core zod
```

And to make the form look a little nicer, we will install the ZodForm Mantine theme and it's dependencies:

```bash
pnpm i @zodform/mantine @mantine/core @mantine/hooks @emotion/react @babel/core
```
