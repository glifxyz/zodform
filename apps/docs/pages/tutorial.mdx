In this tutorial we will build a conference registration form.

The form will have the following requirements:
1. A number of attendees can be added to the form
    - Each attendee will have a first name, last name and email address, all required
    - The first and last name inputs should be in one row, while the email address should be in another
    - A minimum of one attendee is required
2. A checkbox for acceptance of the conference rules, this must be checked to submit the form
3. There should be three products that may be selected to be purchased
    - A T-Shirt
    - A USB Stick
    - A backpack
4. A payment method field should appear when at least one product is selected
    - The payment method should be presented as two radio buttons
    - The payment method should either be a debit card or PayPal
    - If debit card is selected, a card number field should appear and be required
5. Finally, there should be a submit button to submit the form

## Installing the dependencies

First, let's install the ZodForm core dependencies:

```bash
pnpm i @zodform/core zod
```

And to make the form look a little nicer, we will install the ZodForm Mantine theme and it's dependencies:

```bash
pnpm i @zodform/mantine @mantine/core @mantine/hooks @emotion/react @babel/core
```

## Creating the schema

Let's start from the data model. We will need to create a Zod schema for the form, which will look like this:

```ts
import { z } from "zod"

// The schema must be an object
const schema = z
  .object({
    // The attendees field is an array of objects
    attendee: z
      .array(
        z.object({
          // Each attendee has a first name, last name and email address
          firstName: z.string(),
          lastName: z.string(),
          email: z.string().email()
        })
      )
      // There must be at least one attendee.
      // This will also ensure that the array has one element by default.
      .min(1),

    // This will create a checkbox which must be checked
    hasAcceptedRules: z.boolean(),

    /**
    * An array of enums will create a checkbox group.
    * The checkbox group is referred to as "multiChoice" in the library.
    * */
    products: z.array(z.enum(["tshirt", "usb", "backpack"] as const)),

    // The payment method offers two options, debit or PayPal
    // Note that it needs to be optional, because it will only appear when a product is selected
    paymentMethod: z.enum(["paypal", "debit"] as const).optional(),
    // The card number must also be optional, because it will only appear when the debit option is selected
    debitNumber: z.string().optional()
  })
```
