ZodForm is a library for building forms in a declarative way using a Zod schema.

### Motivation

ZodForm is meant to integrate form building into your existing Zod workflows.

As it stands currently, building a form in a Typescript powered React app means:

1. Writing a form schema using Zod
2. Using a form data management library such as `react-hook-form` to manage the form state
3. Writing the markup for the form inputs, and wiring up the event handlers, error messages, etc. to the form library

ZodForm aims to reduce the number of steps required to go from a Zod schema to a form.

### What it isn't

ZodForm is not a replacement for JSON schema based form libraries.
ZodForm is very much inspired by libraries such as [jsonforms](https://jsonforms.io/) and
[react-jsonschema-form](https://react-jsonschema-form.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), though it makes different tradeoffs
when compared to these libraries:

1. ZodForm is TypeScript focused, it isn't portable across languages like JSON schema is
2. JSON schema is just data, it doesn't depend on any runtime and as such can be stored in a datastore.
   ZodForm uses runtime features (such as functions) to generate the form, so it isn't serializable and as such
   cannot be stored in a datastore
