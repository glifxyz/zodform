## `schema`

The `schema` prop is the only required prop. It is a Zod schema, and it must be a `z.object()`.

If you only pass the `schema` to the `Form`, then the form will be rendered with
the default components. These are not really the prettiest, as the default
components are intended to be replaced with your own components.

## `components`

The above leads us nicely into the `components`. The `components` prop is an object
which defines a mapping from a component type to a component definition. The component type is
one of the following:

- `string` - `z.string()`
- `number` - `z.number()`
- `enum` - `z.enum()`
- `boolean` - `z.boolean()`
- `object` - `z.object()`
- `array` - `z.array()`
- `multiChoice` - `z.array(z.enum())`
- `date` - `z.date()`

Whenever the `Form` component encounters a schema of the given type, it will render the
component definition that is mapped to that type. If it doesn't find a component definition,
it will render the default.

### How to create a component definition

A component definition is a React component which takes the appropriate props for its type.
Let's say I want to create a component definition for the `string` type. To do so, I would need to create
a component such as the one below:

```tsx
import { IStringDefaultProps } from '@zodform/core';

function CustomString(props: IStringDefaultProps) {
  // markup...
}
```

All component types have a corresponding interface which defines the props that are passed to
the component definition. All those interfaces can be imported from `@zodform/core`, and are as follows:

- `string` - `IStringDefaultProps`
- `number` - `INumberDefaultProps`
- `enum` - `IEnumDefaultProps`
- `boolean` - `IBooleanDefaultProps`
- `object` - `IObjectDefaultProps`
- `array` - `IArrayDefaultProps`
- `multiChoice` - `IMultiChoiceDefaultProps`
- `date` - `IDateDefaultProps`

Once you have created your component definition, you can add it to a `components` object
and pass that object to the `Form` component:

```tsx
import { Form } from '@zodform/core';
import { CustomString } from './custom-string';

const schema = z.object({
  name: z.string()
});

const components = {
  string: CustomString
} as const;

function MyForm() {
  return <Form schema={schema} components={components} />;
}
```

## `uiSchema`

Since the UI requirements of a form component cannot be satisfied by a Zod schema alone,
we need to introduce an additional concept: the UI schema. This is a schema which matches
the _structure_ of the Zod schema, but it is used for defining UI related properties.

<Callout type="info">
  When talking about the UI schema, it is important to keep in mind the two categories of properties that
  exist:
  - **Leaf properties** - these are properties which render a single input type. All but the object and
  array are leaf properties
  - **Compound properties** - these are properties which contain other properties.
  The object and array are compound properties
</Callout>

### Base properties

The base properties are shared by all _leaf properties_. They are as follows:

- `label` - the label of the component
- `Component` - component which overrides the component definition for this type
- `autoFocus` - whether the component should be focused when the form is rendered
- `cond` - a function which returns a boolean. If the function returns `false`, the component will not be rendered
- `description` - a description of the component. This will override the schema description, if any

### Object properties

Since the object component is tasked with rendering other components, its UI schema needs to
allow for customizing the UI of its children, too. So for an object schema like this:

```ts
import { z } from 'zod';

const schema = z.object({
  person: z.object({
    name: z.string(),
    age: z.number()
  })
});
```

The UI schema would contain the following properties:

- `name` - the UI schema for a string component
- `age` - the UI schema for a number component
- `ui` - the UI schema for the object component itself
  - `title` - the title of the object component
  - `Component` - component which overrides the component definition for this property
  - `Layout` - a component which establishes how the children of the object are rendered.
    This is useful when you want to render the children in a row, for example, but you don't want
    to override the component definition for the entire object. (including its title, etc.) [See example](https://codesandbox.io/s/zodform-docs-layout-87yror?file=/src/App.tsx)
  - `cond` - a function which returns a boolean. If the function returns `false`, the component will not be rendered

### Array properties

The array component is also tasked with rendering other components, though these components do not have a name.
The array is limited to rendering a single type of component, so the UI schema for an array needs to
allow defining the UI for its children's type.

So for an array schema like this:

```ts
import { z } from 'zod';

const schema = z.object({
  fruits: z.array(z.string())
});
```

The UI schema would contain the following properties:

- `title` - same as the object
- `description` - same as the object
- `cond` - same as the object
- `element` - the UI schema for the child type.
  In this case it is a string, so it would be the same as the base properties
